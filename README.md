# My First GitHub Repository ðŸš€

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first ever GitHub repo created on mobile. I'm currently learning the basics of GitHub, coding, and version control.

## ðŸ“± What I'm Using:
- GitHub mobile app
- Learning by doing
- FreeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials

## ðŸ”§ What This Repo Contains:
- Experiments with README files
- Practice files and notes
- Beginner-level projects (coming soon!)

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo?
I want to build a strong developer profile, show my progress, and slowly work on cool projects as I learn more.
